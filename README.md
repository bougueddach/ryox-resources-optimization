# ryox-resources-optimization

This REST API is a resource optimization API using the constraint solver OptaPlanner and Spring framework. 
It contain an implemetation of Traveling sales man -TSP- algorithme ==> FUNCTIONNAL (you will find another repo in this account of a very basic front-end to highlight this service )
It also contains an implementation of vehicle routing algorithme ==> not functionnal for the moment.

this work was done in a context of an internship in Sillaps Factory to evaluate the performance of OptaPlanner for a potontiel use in their solutions.
